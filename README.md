# Major-Jam-2-Submission
My submission to the [Major Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/major-jam-2) game jam.

This game was made in a 1-week time interval. It was designed under the constraint
that only **one** texture file was allowed, with a size of **128x128** pixels. In
other words, every sprite in the game is stored in a single 128x128px texture file
(located [here](/src/res/sprites.png)).

This project was written in Java, and uses LWJGL, PNGDecoder, JOML and Gson.

*TODO: Add setup and installation instructions*
